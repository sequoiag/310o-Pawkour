I interpreted the game these of Everything is Alive with a rather literal sense. I decided to make all the 
objects in my game space living objects to be incorporated into a parkour game. I attempted to make living buildings to be enemies of my main character the cat, however the complexity of it didnt match fully with the
low poly style I was using so I decided to only make two living buildings. For the rest of my moving objects 
I just wrote a short little script that moves my objects back and for and then gave them eyes to embody 
sentience. In addition I made sure to put eyes on the other non moving objects in my scene. Overwall I found 
the prompt to be exiting and fun!
